## Overview

Design a 4K (3840x2160 pixels) virtual background suitable for Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and NVIDIA Broadcast.

The background should reflect a clean, modern, and professional environment with soft natural lighting and a calming neutral palette (greys, whites, warm woods). The center area must remain visually clean so the speaker stays in focus. Do not include any visible floors, desks, chairs, or foreground clutter.

Architectural, decorative, and stylistic choices are to be defined using the questions below.
